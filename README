Several altruistic developers have created a collection of wrappers for the Pillbox API.
   - Ruby:   http://github.com/kgautreaux/pillbox <= will be gemified and available through rubyforge: 'gem install pillboxr'
   - Python: http://github.com/eyeseast/pillbox

API provided through the generous support by the FDA in both money and resources. Work conducted by NLM at NIH.

Please contact david.hale at nlm.nih.gov for an api key. There is no bandwidth limit currently. (is this still true David?)
